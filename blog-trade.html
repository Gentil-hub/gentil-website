      U.S. House Votes to End Trump’s Tariffs on Canadian Imports
    </h1>

    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-6">
      Wednesday Night, February 11, 2026
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Late Wednesday night, February 11, 2026, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 219–211 to advance a resolution to end President Donald Trump's tariffs imposed on Canadian imports. While this is a major step in Congress, the measure still must pass the U.S. Senate and survive a potential veto from Trump.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Around the time of the vote, Trump posted on Truth Social that:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic mb-4">
      “Canada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years. They are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">
      His comments reflect ongoing tensions over cross-border trade policy.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This debate comes as Canada pursues a strategy of diversifying its international trade relationships beyond the United States:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        On September 24, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a new bilateral trade agreement with Indonesia, marking Canada’s first free trade deal with an ASEAN country and opening more opportunities in Southeast Asia.
      </li>
      <li>
        On January 16, 2026, Carney also forged a new strategic partnership with China, focused on cooperation in energy, agri-food, and trade. It is not a full trade agreement, but it establishes deeper economic ties.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Trump reacted sharply to the China partnership on Truth Social, stating:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic mb-4">
      “Prime Minister Carney wants to make a deal with China — which will eat Canada alive. We’ll just get the leftovers! I don’t think so.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">
      In the same post he joked that:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic mb-4">
      “The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-6">
      As the Senate now considers the House resolution, this moment highlights how trade policy, geopolitics, and Canada’s evolving global strategy are intersecting in ways that could reshape North American economic relations.
